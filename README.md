# Long-term extreme response of an offshore turbine

This GitHub repository belongs to the publication "Long-term extreme response of an 
offshore turbine: How accurate are contour-based estimates?" by Haselsteiner, Mackay, 
Frieling, Sander and Thoben. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2021.09.077

It contains 
 * openFast input files (folder "01-simulations"), 
 * scripts that were used in the analysis of the study (folder "02-scripts"), 
 * structural properties of the turbine's tower (folder "03-tower") and 
 * figures (folders "02-scripts" and "04-handmade-figures"). 

Due to GitHub's file size restriction two datasets are available at a dedicated 
data repository: time series of environmental conditions and openFAST simulation results.
The data repository is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5013306.

These files must be placed into the two data folders of this repo that the scripts can run sucessfully:
* here: https://github.com/ahaselsteiner/2021-extreme-response/tree/master/02-scripts/EnvironmentalModel/Data and 
* here: https://github.com/ahaselsteiner/2021-extreme-response/tree/master/02-scripts/ResponseEmulator/Data
